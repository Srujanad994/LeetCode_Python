#Method to reverse linked list - linked list is where data is stored in nodes and they are linked to each other. Unlike arrays, data cannot be accessed from some middle node and must be traversed from head to end. Useful for related data lists.

def reverseList(self,unreversed_list):
        # initialize variables
        previous = None         # `previous` initially points to None
        current = list.head     # `current` points at the first element
        following = current.next    # `following` points at the second element

        # go till the last element of the list
        while current:
            current.next = previous # reverse the link
            previous = current      # move `previous` one step ahead
            current = following         # move `current` one step ahead
            if following:               # if this was not the last element
                following = following.next    # move `following` one step ahead
